# Description

In this project, I built a web scraping system with Python to extract information from the website [Immobiliare.it](https://www.immobiliare.it/vendita-case/torino/?criterio=rilevanza), setting the location as Turin and ordering the results by relevance.

I decided to insert the title of each ad, the date of publication on the platform, the listing price, whether the property has been discounted or not, the number of rooms inside the property, the surface in square meters, the number of bathrooms and at which floor the property is.

I included the final csv file that results from the extraction and the process of structuring the data in a tabular format.
