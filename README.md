# Description

In this project, I built a web scraping system with Python to extract information from the website [Immobiliare.it](https://www.immobiliare.it/vendita-case/torino/?criterio=rilevanza), setting the location as Turin and ordering the results by relevance.

I included the final csv file that results from the extraction and the process of structuring the data in a tabular format.
